# What is a Linked List

```
  - 1. When several members of a family stay in the same house, we can say that they live in an array
  - 2. the proximity of the rooms in the same house is conceptually similar to an array
  - 3. When one family member moves from her house to her college 17,00 miles away, they are still family i.e. Linked but 
  - 4. Not staying in the confituus houses / rooms anymore
  - 5. Members of the family then has the address of the family member living far way in a college dorm, creating a linked list.
```
