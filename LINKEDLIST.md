# What is a Linked List

```
  - 1. When several members of a family stay in the same house, we can say that they live in an array
  - 2. the proximity of the rooms in the same house is conceptually similar to an array
  - 3. When one family member moves from her house to her college 17,00 miles away, they are still family i.e. Linked but 
  - 4. Not staying in the confituus houses / rooms anymore
  - 5. Members of the family then has the address of the family member living far way in a college dorm, creating a linked list.
```

## What is a basic building block of a Linked List

### The Node class which contains two parts

```
- 1. The Data part that can hold any Object
- 2. The next part that holds the memory address of the next Node in sequence
```

## What is the Head / Start Address

```
  - 1. Say Miss Graf wants to find the phone number of Mr. David but she only knows Mr. David's Mom's phone phone number
  - 2. So she first calls Mr. David's Mom
  - 3. Asks for Mr. David's Phone Number from his Mom
  - 4. Then calls Mr. David
  - 5. Miss. Graph is here the Head or the Start Address because she is the one starting the search / traversal of the list
  - 6. The two elements in this list are Mr. David's Mom (The first Element) and Mr. David the second and last element.
