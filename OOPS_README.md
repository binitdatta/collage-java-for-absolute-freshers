``` 
- 1. We all know the Englsh meaning of the word Object 
- 2. Objects are living and non living beings that can seen touched, that can move, feel if living etc.
- 3. Oriented means when something aligns/positions itself against something else
- 4. In this case, Programming which is the act of training computers how to act on our behalf Oriented itself with Objects
- 5. Meaning Programming will borrow from the principles of living and non living objects and work like real life objects behave in their lives.
- 6. As Humans we are in someway or the other programmed ourselves.
- 7. Like if a bug bites us or we get bitten by a mosquito, our sense organs carry the signal to our brain
- 8. Our brains interpret the source of the pain as a bug, identifies the location and
- 9. Sends a signal to our hands to act to remove the bug or the mosquito
- 10. In this total human behavior there are multiple objects involved
- 11. Our skin which has nerve ends
- 12. Our eyes which locates the bug/mosquito
- 13. Our hands which takes action to remove the bug/mosquito
- 14. And Finally our Brain which orchestrates the entire sequence of actions
- 15. Now think about we are building a human like robot and want to train the robot in behaving similarly when a bug/mosquito comes its way
- 16. The robot does not have nay life and is a non living object
- 17. Thus, we are actually programming an object which is the Robot
- 18. When we program the object i.e. the Robot, we want to model the same organs like we mentioned in humans
- 19. The organs are Skin, Eyes, Hands and Brain. 
- 20. We will build each organ and make them send messages / signals to each other and act in a coordinated way like humans act
- 21. Thus, we can see Object Oriented Programming works with Objects , and is very much real life like

# Object Oriented Programming, however has some attributes that needs explanation before we further.

# What is Encapsulation

``` 
- 1. I am an Object, a living one 
- 2. I contain other smaller objects like a heart, two kidneys, one liver, one pancreus and other organs
- 3. I also encapsulate those inner organs or keep in the capsule of my body/skin
- 4. We can say objects hide or encapsulate their some of their organs inside their body
- 5. A Vehicle is also an object encapsulates its engine and other parts
- 6. We take the same concept (we model Objects from real life in Object Oriented Programming, remember) to OOP
- 7. We determine what parts of an Object are hidden/kept private from the external world
- 8. Like if we model the Robot, we will keep some of its organs (electrinics in this case) private or hidden by its outer skin made of steel
- 9. Some of our organs are however visible like our eyes, face, hands etc.
- 10. These organs are public visible from outside.
- 11. If we now model an ATM machine Object, the cash would be its heart i.e. inner / hidden organ
- 12. Like a doctor can feel our heartbits with a stethosope , ATMs let users interact with it through the ATM Cards
- 13. Thus, Encapsulation is the practice of identifying, declaring and keeping things hidden but letting the hidden things interact with the world
