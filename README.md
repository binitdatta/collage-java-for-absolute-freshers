# Welcome to the Life Changing Journey of Learning How to Program in Java in a Fun Filled Way

## Prerequisite

``` 
- 1. We understand what a compyter is and have seen / used one for playing games, post on social media, writing an essay etc.
- 2. We understand what a Central Processing Unit ot CPU it : It is the computer's brain
- 3. We understand what Random Access Memory or RAM is : It is the memory where computers stores things
- 4. We understand what a hard disk is : It is the permanent storage that can save the files when we shut the computer
- 5. We understand what a computer direcotry or folder is
- 6. We understand what a computer file is : myphone.jpeg, mydogs-photo-png, my-second-term-essay.docx etc
- 7. We understand that the total computer file has two parts. 
- 8. The first part is the file name and ends before the . (DOT) : my-second-term-essay
- 9. The second part is the file extension and starts after the . (DOT) : docx
```

# First Some Basic Questions Needs to be answered

## What is Programming

``` 
- 1. Programming is a way of communicating what we want to the computers like your laptop, your parents desktop, your smartphone, tablet etc.
- 2. Programming is to talking to the computers like English or Spanish Language is to talking to a Person who knows English or Spanish
- 3. These days Programming is touching all our lives as computers do all sorts of jobs helping us buy things online, chatting with best friends, post pictures on social media etc.
```

## What id the difference between Computer Programming and Talking in English

``` 
- 1. In English Conversation, both persons know English
- 2. However, in our conversation with the Computer using a Programming Language such as Java or JavaSCript, the Computer itself does not understand Java or JavaScript
- 3. All Computers only understands electronic signals which are expressed in zeros and ones.
- 4. These zeros and ones are called bits
- 5. Humans however, do not understand zeros and ones that well
- 6. Thus, when we talk to the computers in a programming language, there is a special program called Interprter that translates the English like programs or our talk to the zeros or ones
- 7. So that computers would be able to understand our talk and executes our commands now in zeros and ones.
- 8. Thus the special program called the Interprter knows the programming language we know and the zeros and ones the computers know
- 9. This is much like a person knowing English visiting Chica and talking to a Chinese person knowing Mandarin, through an Interprter who knows both English and Chinese
```

## What is Java

``` 
- 1. Java is a Computer Programming Language
- 2. Java and other Computer Programming Languages are for human programmers to use
- 3. Thus they look and work like the English Language with some differences
- 4. Humans have brains and intelligence but computers do not have any intelligence on their own.
- 5. Thus all computer languages are significantly more detailed than a human language like English.
```

## What is Java Development Kit or JDK

``` 
- 1. Like we said we cannot directly talk to the computers in zeros or ones
- 2. And computers do not understand our English like Java Programs
- 3. Thus we need a middle person to take our Java Programs and convert them into a form that computers can understand
- 4. One of these middle persons are called Java Interpreter or Compiler
- 5. Once interpretted , the converted Java programs are stored in special computer file with an extension .class
- 6. There is another program that takes the .class files and runs them
- 7. Like the two above several other similar tools are packaged in the box called the JDK
- 8. We cannot write and run java programs without installing the JDK in our computer
```

## What is a Terminal

``` 
- 1. A Computer Terminal is a special program that takes commands from use computer users
- 2. Examples of commands like running a program, copying files, deleting files etc.
```

## How do I install the JDK on my computer say a mac?

``` 
- 1. Open a Chrome or Safari browser 
- 2. Enter https://sdkman.io/install
- 3. Open a Terminal on your mac
- 4. Enter the command : curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
- 5. Press Enter
- 6. Enter the following command : source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
- 7. Enter the following command : sdk version
- 8. You will the sdkman version installed
```

## How to install JDK on our Mac

``` 
Run the command : sdk install java 11.0.15-zulu
Wait till the command finishes running, Enter Y for the question asked

Installing: java 11.0.15-zulu
Done installing!

Do you want java 11.0.15-zulu to be set as default? (Y/n): y

Setting java 11.0.15-zulu as default.

```

## How to verify that Java JDK is installed on our mac

```
Run java -version on the command line terminal

Command output

openjdk version "11.0.15" 2022-04-19 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.56+19-CA (build 11.0.15+10-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.56+19-CA (build 11.0.15+10-LTS, mixed mode)

```

## What is an Integrated Development Environment or an IDE?

``` 
- 1. Most of us have  used Editing software like Microsoft Word or Google Docs
- 2. Microsoft Word or Google Docs saves our work behind the scene, helps spell checkes and grammer checks
- 3. IDEs are to Java Programming or Programming in General as Microsoft Word / Google Docs are to Writing an Essay
- 4. They highlight errors, help us write less by completing parts etc.
- 5. They also can help run the programs we write with a few mouse clicks
- 6. IDEs are all free most of the time
```

## How to download and install an IDE

``` 
- 1. Open a Chrome or Safari Browser 
- 2. Enter www.google.com in the top navigation bad
- 3. Enter IntelliJ in the google search box
- 4. Click on the first result : https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
```
