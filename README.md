# Welcome to the Life Changing Journey of Learning How to Program in Java in a Fun Filled Way

# First Some Basic Questions Needs to be answered

## What is Programming

``` 
- 1. Programming is a way of communicating what we want to the computers like your laptop, your parents desktop, your smartphone, tablet etc.
- 2. Programming is to talking to the computers like English or Spanish Language is to talking to a Person who knows English or Spanish
- 3. These days Programming is touching all our lives as computers do all sorts of jobs helping us buy things online, chatting with best friends, post pictures on social media etc.
```

## What id the difference between Computer Programming and Talking in English

``` 
- 1. In English Conversation, both persons know English
- 2. However, in our conversation with the Computer using a Programming Language such as Java or JavaSCript, the Computer itself does not understand Java or JavaScript
- 3. All Computers only understands electronic signals which are expressed in zeros and ones.
- 4. These zeros and ones are called bits
- 5. Humans however, do not understand zeros and ones that well
- 6. Thus, when we talk to the computers in a programming language, there is a special program called Interprter that translates the English like programs or our talk to the zeros or ones
- 7. So that computers would be able to understand our talk and executes our commands now in zeros and ones.
- 8. Thus the special program called the Interprter knows the programming language we know and the zeros and ones the computers know
- 9. This is much like a person knowing English visiting Chica and talking to a Chinese person knowing Mandarin, through an Interprter who knows both English and Chinese
```

## What is Java

``` 
- 1. Java is a Computer Programming Language
- 2. Java and other Computer Programming Languages are for human programmers to use
- 3. Thus they look and work like the English Language with some differences
- 4. Humans have brains and intelligence but computers do not have any intelligence on their own.
- 5. Thus all computer languages are significantly more detailed than a human language like English.
